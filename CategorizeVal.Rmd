### Creating Categorical Variables from Continuous/Numeric Variables
Sometimes numeric variables need to be broken down into categorical variables or factors. 
This can be done for a variety of reasons. 
There is a useful function called cut2 in the Hmisc package. We install it and use it below.
```{r}
if(!("Hmisc" %in% installed.packages()[,1])) {
 install.packages("Hmisc",repos="https://cloud.r-project.org")
 }
library(Hmisc)
```

brake down into 5 groups
```{r}
dat2$age.cat <- cut2(dat2$age,g=5)
table(dat2$age.cat)
```

at defined points
```{r}
dat2$age.cat2 <- cut2(dat2$age,c(25,40,55,70,85))
table(dat2$age.cat2)
```
